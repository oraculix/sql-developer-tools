There are also additions to the Optimizer Hints category.

### Placement
On Windows, this File is located in the folder "%APPDATA%\SQL Developer".
You should copy this file to its folder while SQL Developer is closed. It will be loaded the next time you open SQL Developer.

## Reports

User defined reports, particularly for Statspack but also for other features SQL Developer doesn't provide out of the box.

To install a report, first click on "View - Reports", then navigate to the "User defined reports" folder. Right-click on the folder and click "open report" to import one report definition at a time.
